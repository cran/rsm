NEWS for rsm package

Changes in version 1.41 (July 28, 2012)

  * Added a NAMESPACE so it will work in newer versions of R
  

Changes in version 1.40 (July 28, 2010)

  * Fixed scoping bugs in 'model.data' (affects 'contour.lm' etc.)
  
  * Fixed scoping bugs in 'rsm'
  
  * Fix to 'rsm' -- coding worked incorrectly when 'data' keyword
    was not given explicitly.  Side effect: 'data' is no longer a 
    separate argument, it's just part of '...'
  
  * Added 'inscribed' optional argument to 'ccd'
    (Thanks to Ron Behlinger for suggesting this)
  
  * 'contour.lm' checks to ensure that elements of 'at' and 'bounds',
    if provided, are named.
  
  * New 'atlab' argument in 'contour.lm' and related functions.
    Now by default, the 'at' values are displayed for variables not on
    the coordinate axes; 'atlab' specifies where this information is
    shown, or suppresses it.
  

Changes in version 1.31 (December 19, 2009)

  * Fixed logic bug in contour.lm - didn't handle xlabs correctly


Changes in version 1.30 (December 16, 2009)

  * Enhanced contour.lm with hooks and improved axis labeling
    Also changed default to image=FALSE -- seems more "pure"
  
  * Added persp.lm for perspective plots akin to contour.lm
  
  * Added image.lm for image-only plots akin to contour.lm
  
  * Added 'codings' methods for coded.data and rsm objects
  
  * Added 'canonical' method for rsm for more convenient access
  
  * Updated references to 3rd ed. of Myers, Montgomery, Anderson-Cook
    (also corrected misspelling of Myers -- my apologies to Ray.)
  
  * Additional vignette "rsm-plots" describing contour, image, persp
    in more detail


Changes in version 1.21 (October 30, 2009)

  * Bug fix in contour.lm (axis labeling was reversed whern image=FALSE)
    Thanks to Eduard Sturm for reporting this
  

Changes in version 1.20 (October 20, 2009)

  * Replaced citation to point to paper published in JSS
  
  * Replaced vignette by JSS article


Changes in version 1.13 (12 October, 2009)

  * Fixed one misused macro in documentation


Changes in version 1.12 (5 May, 2009)

  * Modified CITATION file to conform to standards


Changes in version 1.11 (6 March, 2009)

  * Changed last variable name to 'logSD' in 'heli' and clarified 
    documentation for that dataset
    
  * Fixed bug in contour.lm relating to original use of model formula,
    e.g. it now works with for model fitted by 'lm(swiss)'


Changes from version 1.10 (30 December, 2008)

  * Added functions ccd() and bbd() for generating RS designs
  
  * Added function ccd.pick() to help in choosing good CCDs
  
  * Added checks in rsm() for aliased parameters

  * Added NEWS and CITATION files.
  
  * Tweaks/corrections/additions to documentation and vignettes.
  

Changes from version 1.01 (5 December 2008)

  * Added canonical.path function
  
  * Modified formula handling in coded.data and relatives so that any
    legal expression will work (as long as it's linear!)
  
  * Overhauled contour.lm, with different argument list.  Now it is much 
    easier to use, and can produce multiple plots with one call.
    
  * Provided a true vignette.  Other improvements to documentation.
